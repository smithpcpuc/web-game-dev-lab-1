## Self-Reflection:
Being very condused and not knowing what to do is somewhat depressing. Especially just learning something and literally forgetting after a while. 
My CSS skills arent good at all, so I couldnt figure out how to position my text for the sections, which infuriated me to no end. Even if I did look it up to try and fix every thing it would take too much time. I am surprised I even passed my Fundamentals of Web Dev class. I had to ask the professor quite a bit of questions in regards to some of the issues of doing the assignment such as the NPM test errors, and basic stuff like "git add" and "git push". Partially ashamed but you learn through doing things and asking questions.

### How long it took me to finish this?
4 days
